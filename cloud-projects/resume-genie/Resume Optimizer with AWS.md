### **Introduction:**  

Amazon PartyRock is an exciting new AI-powered application builder from AWS. In this guide, we'll create an AI-powered Resume Builder using AWS PartyRock. This application will help users craft personalised resumes by suggesting improvements and tailoring content to specific job descriptions. We'll leverage PartyRock's AI capabilities to analyze resumes, provide feedback, and optimize content for targeted job applications.

### **Getting Started with PartyRock**

* To begin, you'll need an AWS account with access to PartyRock.  
  1. Navigate to https://partyrock.aws/ and sign in with your AWS credentials.  
  2. If you're new to PartyRock, take a moment to explore the interface and available templates.  
  3. Click on "Create new app" to start your project.

Generating the AI-Powered Resume Builder

In the PartyRock dashboard, select "Generate app".

<img width="1555" alt="generate app" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba35b35a-6c58-4a62-9569-ac89ab8ee5aa">


   Here you can create an app in two ways.  

   
   <img width="941" alt="build app option" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af138712-85b1-43a0-b3cf-45acb3b811f2">

   
   **Option 1: Start with a Prompt:**  
   
   A 1â€“3 sentence prompt will usually work, or you can choose to be more descriptive. Write about what you want your app to take as input and generate as output. For tips about how to create a good prompt, see [**Prompt engineering guidelines** in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-engineering-guidelines.html)  
   
   After you submit your prompt, PartyRock assembles an app for you.  
   
   You can then test, edit, and share the app.  
   
   **Option 2: Start from Scratch:**  
   
   If you prefer starting with a blank page, get started building from scratch. This can be the route to go if you have a specific layout in mind or if you want to have more control as you try out a new concept. You can configure the initial widgets yourself instead of having the PartyRock app builder assemble them

*In this guide, we are going with* ***Option 2***\*.\*

### **Creating the app:**

In this page, you can change the name of the app . You can also start by clicking the create new widget.

<img width="1561" alt="create app option" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9afa73f8-abbb-4592-b79d-61c4bb8c8e48">


I have changed the name to ' Resume Genie '

**Let's add the widgets for the app:**

<img width="1565" alt="widget 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c49d135-8c5d-4f04-9305-487ffbabc845">


<img width="1553" alt="widget 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/151b84f9-3971-4092-96f4-ae472ff1ca6a">

**Adding the other widgets:**

Make sure all the widgets have the proper placeholders. You can also choose any AI model to generate your content for the resume.


**Adding the Chatbot widget:**

This will help the user to ask further questions and suggestions on the resume and cover letter.
